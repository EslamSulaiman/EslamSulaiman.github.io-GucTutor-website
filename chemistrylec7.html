    <h2>Introduction to Engineering Materials</h2>
    <p>Engineering materials are fundamental to modern technology and production, with properties determining their vast applications.</p>

    <h3>Types of Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classical Materials:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**Metals:** Known for excellent conductivity, strength, and ductility.
                    <br><em>Example:</em> Steel used in building structures, Copper in electrical wiring.
                </li>
                <li>**Ceramics:** Typically brittle, high melting points, and good insulators.
                    <br><em>Example:</em> Pottery, bricks, and specialized refractories.
                </li>
                <li>**Polymers:** Large molecules, often flexible and lightweight.
                    <br><em>Example:</em> Various plastics (like PVC pipes, water bottles), rubber.
                </li>
                <li>**Semiconductors:** Materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators.
                    <br><em>Example:</em> Silicon (Si) chips in computers and electronic devices.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Materials:</strong> Include Electronic Materials (e.g., for microchips) and Composite Materials (combining two or more distinct materials).
            <br><em>Example:</em> Fiberglass (glass fibers in a polymer matrix), carbon fiber composites used in aircraft.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Materials of the Future:</strong> Emerging materials with unique properties.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Nanomaterials (materials engineered at the nanoscale), Smart Materials (e.g., shape-memory alloys that return to a pre-set shape).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Periodic Table and Elements Classification:</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is an indispensable tool for classifying elements and predicting their material behavior.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Metals:** Form the largest group, approximately 91 out of 120 known elements. They are typically lustrous, malleable, and good conductors.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Aluminum (Al).
        </li>
        <li>**Nonmetals:** About 18 elements, often insulators, can be gases, liquids, or brittle solids.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Chlorine (Cl).
        </li>
        <li>**Metalloids:** Possess properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals, often acting as semiconductors.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Boron (B), Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Chemical Bonding:</h2>
    <p>The type of bond between atoms profoundly influences the material's properties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Ionic Bonding:** Occurs between a metal and a non-metal, involving the transfer of electrons to form oppositely charged ions that attract each other.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Sodium (Na) donates an electron to Chlorine (Cl) to form $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$, resulting in Sodium Chloride (NaCl), or table salt.
        </li>
        <li>**Covalent Bonding:** Occurs typically between two non-metals, involving the sharing of electrons to achieve stable electron configurations.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Two Oxygen atoms sharing electrons to form an $\text{O}_2$ molecule (oxygen gas), or Hydrogen and Oxygen sharing electrons in a water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).
        </li>
        <li>**Metallic Bonding:** Occurs between metal atoms, where valence electrons are delocalized and shared among a lattice of positive metal ions, forming an "electron sea." This explains metals' excellent conductivity and malleability.
            <br><em>Example:</em> The bonds within a solid piece of copper wire, allowing electrons to flow freely.
        </li>
    </ul>
