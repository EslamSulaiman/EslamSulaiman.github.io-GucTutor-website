    <h2>1.2 What is Chemistry?</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, and how it interacts, combines, and changes. It explores the composition, structure, and behavior of substances, and the energy changes that occur during these processes.</p>

    <h2>1.3 Role of Chemistry in Engineering</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is fundamental to almost all branches of engineering. Engineers rely on chemical principles to understand materials, design processes, and develop new technologies. Some key areas include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Materials Engineering:</strong> Understanding the chemical structure and properties of materials (metals, polymers, ceramics, composites) to design new ones or improve existing ones for specific applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Engineering:</strong> Directly applies chemical, physical, and biological principles to design, operate, and optimize industrial processes that transform raw materials into valuable products.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Engineering:</strong> Uses chemical knowledge to analyze pollutants, design water treatment systems, manage waste, and develop sustainable environmental solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Civil Engineering:</strong> Involves the chemistry of construction materials like concrete, steel, and asphalt, understanding their durability and reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Engineering:</strong> Relates to the chemistry of semiconductors, batteries, and other electronic components.</li>
        <li><strong>Biomedical Engineering:</strong> Involves the chemistry of biological systems, drug delivery, and biocompatible materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.4 The Scientific Method in Chemistry and Engineering</h2>
    <p>Both chemistry and engineering heavily rely on the scientific method, which is a systematic approach to research. It typically involves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Noticing phenomena and asking questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Forming a testable explanation for the observation.</li>
        <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Designing and conducting experiments to test the hypothesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Interpreting experimental data.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Drawing conclusions and refining the hypothesis if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In engineering, this often translates into problem definition, conceptual design, detailed design, prototyping, testing, and refinement.</p>
