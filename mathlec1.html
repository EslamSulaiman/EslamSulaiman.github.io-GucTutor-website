        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Solving and analyzing the mathematical model.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Translating mathematical conclusions back into real-world insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Testing and confirming predictions/explanations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>III. Chapter 1: Basics of Numbers & Inequalities</h2>

    <h3>A. Fundamental Concepts of Numbers:</h3>
    <p>Topics include distinguishing between discrete and continuous data values, and between rational and irrational numbers.</p>
    <h4>1.1 The Real Numbers; The Number Line:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural numbers:</strong> $\text{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$</li>
        <li><strong>Whole numbers:</strong> $\text{N}^* = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$</li>
        <li><strong>Integers:</strong> $\text{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$</li>
        <li><strong>Rational numbers:</strong> $\text{Q} = \{x = \frac{n}{m}; n, m \in \text{Z}; m \neq 0\}$</li>
        <li><strong>Irrational numbers:</strong> $\text{Q}' = \{e, \pi, \sqrt{2}, \dots\}$</li>
        <li><strong>Real numbers:</strong> $\text{R} = \text{Q} \cup \text{Q}' = ]-\infty, \infty[$</li>
        <li>Every real number corresponds to a unique point on the number line.</li>
        <li>Ordering of real numbers: $a < b$ if $b - a$ is positive, or if $a$ precedes $b$ on the number line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Some Remarks on Numbers:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Decimal representation distinguishes rational (terminating/repeating decimals) from irrational (non-terminating/non-repeating decimals) numbers.</li>
        <li>Example: $0.999999\dots = 1$.</li>
        <li>Proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational (by contradiction, covered in tutorials).</li>
        <li>Locating $\sqrt{5}$ on the real line using a right-angle triangle.</li>
        <li>Sums/differences of integers, rationals, and reals are integers, rationals, and reals, respectively.</li>
        <li>Sum of two irrationals is not always irrational.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1.2 Integer Exponents of Real Numbers & Laws of Exponents</h4>
    <h4>1.3 Radicals and Rational Exponents & Laws of Radicals</h4>

    <h3>B. Techniques of Solving Equations and Inequalities:</h3>
    <p>This section covers various types of equations and inequalities.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1.4 Introduction:</strong> Definition of equation (statement of equality between algebraic expressions) and its solution (values that make it true). Distinction between Identity (true for all values) and Conditional equation (true for some values).</li>
        <li><strong>1.5 Solving Linear Equations:</strong> Standard form $Ax+B=0$ with a single solution $x = -\frac{B}{A}$.</li>
        <li><strong>1.6 Solving Quadratic Equations:</strong> Standard form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ (where $a \neq 0$) with two solutions. Methods include factorization and the quadratic formula ($x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$).</li>
        <li><strong>1.7 Solving Other Types of Equations.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1.8 Solutions of Inequalities:</strong> Definition of inequality (expressions related by $<, >, \leq, \geq$) and its solution (interval of values that satisfy it). Types of intervals: bounded (finite) and unbounded (infinite).</li>
        <li>**1.9 Equations and Inequalities Involving Absolute Value:** Covers equations of the form $\vert u \vert = c$ and inequalities like $\vert u \vert < c$, and $\vert u \vert > c$, etc.</li>
    </ul>
