    <h1>Production Technology: Lecture 2 - Measurement</h1>

    <div class="lecture-content">
        <h2>Introduction to Measurement</h2>
        <p>Measurement is a critical aspect of production technology, essential for quality control and ensuring products meet precise specifications.</p>

        <h3>Need for Inspection:</h3>
        <p>Measuring is important in the industrial world to ensure product quality and adherence to design specifications.</p>

        <h3>Standardization:</h3>
        <p>Standardization is the process of conforming to established rules or measures. It's crucial in modern industry to ensure interchangeability of products between different manufacturers and countries. Standards are set by organizations like the International Standards Organization (ISO), British Standards Institution (BSI), Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN), and American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</p>

        <h3>Precision and Accuracy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Refers to how close a measured value is to the true or known value. For example, if the actual weight of a substance is 10 kg, but your measurement is consistently 3.2 kg, it is not accurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other, indicating reproducibility. If you weigh a substance five times and get 3.2 kg each time, your measurement is very precise, even if not accurate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's possible to have measurements that are accurate and precise, precise but not accurate, or neither accurate nor precise.</p>

        <h3>Calibration:</h3>
        <p>Calibration is the procedure where a measurement instrument is checked against a known standard to ensure its accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Measurement Methods:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Measurement:</strong> The value of a quantity is obtained directly by comparing the unknown with a standard, without mathematical calculations. An example is measuring thickness using a Vernier Caliper.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect Measurement:</strong> Several related parameters are measured directly, and then the desired value is determined using a mathematical relationship. An example is measuring density by measuring mass and geometrical dimensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Direct Measuring Tools:</h2>
        <p>Common direct measuring tools include Workshop Steel Rulers, Vernier Calipers, Micrometers, Simple Workshop Protractors, Vernier Protractors, and Try Squares.</p>

        <h3>1. Workshop Steel Ruler:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically has inch and centimeter divisions.</li>
            <li>Can measure down to 1 mm.</li>
            <li>Often has conversion charts on the back.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Vernier Caliper:</h3>
        <p>A precision instrument capable of more accurate measurements than a ruler.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can have different precisions, such as 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm, or 0.02 mm.</li>
            <li><strong>Example Reading:</strong> The PDF includes examples where readings of Vernier Calipers result in values like 106.5 mm and 44.6 mm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Micrometer:</h3>
        <p>Used for even higher precision measurements of small lengths, thicknesses, and diameters.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example Reading:</strong> An example reading shown in the lecture yields 7.38 mm (composed of 7 mm from the main scale, 0 mm from the thimble scale main divisions, and 0.38 mm from the thimble scale subdivisions). Another example results in 3.77 mm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Protractors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Workshop Protractor:</strong> Used for general angle measurements.</li>
            <li><strong>Vernier Bevel Protractor:</strong> Offers higher precision for angle measurements, utilizing a vernier scale.</li>
        </ul>
