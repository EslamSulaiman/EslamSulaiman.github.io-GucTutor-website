    <h2>Extrema Points</h2>
    <h3>The maximum and minimum values of a function</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute Extrema</li>
        <li>Local Extrema</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> One of the most important applications of calculus of differentiation is to find the best way to perform a certain task. This problem is eventually known as the optimization problem. Solving an optimization problem usually reduces to finding the maximum or the minimum value of a function and determine where this value occurs. Our task, in this Lecture, concentrates on developing some mathematical tools for solving this problem.</p>

    <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <h3>Absolute Maximum, Absolute Minimum</h3>
    <p>Let $f$ be a function with domain $D$. Then $f$ has an absolute maximum value on $D$ at a point $c$ if $f(x)\le f(c)$ for all $x$ in $D$ and an absolute minimum value on $D$ at $c$ if $f(x)\ge f(c)$ for all $x$ in $D$.</p>
    <p>The existence of absolute maximum or minimum depends on the function and on its domain.</p>
    <p>For example, for $y=x^2$:
        <ul>
            <li>On $D=(-\infty, \infty)$, there is only an absolute minimum.</li>
            <li>On $D=[0, 2]$, there are absolute maximum and minimum.</li>
            <li>On $D=(0, 2]$, there is only an absolute maximum.</li>
            <li>On $D=(0, 2)$, there is no maximum or minimum.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h3>Local Maximum, Local Minimum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A function $f$ has a local maximum value at an interior point $c$ of its domain if $f(x)\le f(c)$ for all $x$ in some open interval containing $c$.</li>
        <li>A function $f$ has a local minimum value at an interior point $c$ of its domain if $f(x)\ge f(c)$ for all $x$ in some open interval containing $c$.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Distinction between local and absolute extrema:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local maximum: No greater value of $f$ nearby.</li>
        <li>Absolute maximum: No greater value of $f$ anywhere. Also a local maximum.</li>
        <li>Local minimum: No smaller value of $f$ nearby.</li>
        <li>Absolute minimum: No smaller value of $f$ anywhere. Also a local minimum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Extreme Value Theorem</h2>
    <p>If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ attains both an absolute maximum value $M$ and an absolute minimum value $m$ in $[a, b]$. That is, there are numbers $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in $[a, b]$ with $f(x_{1})=m$, $f(x_{2})=M$ and $m\le f(x)\le M$ for every other $x$ in $[a, b]$.</p>
    <p>Absolute maximum or minimum may occur at an interior point or at an end point.</p>
    <p>Even a single point of discontinuity can keep a function from having either a maximum or minimum value on a closed interval. For example, the function $y=\begin{cases}x,&0\le x<1\\ 0,&x=1\end{cases}$ is continuous at every point of $[0, 1]$ except $x=1$, yet its graph over $[0, 1]$ does not have a highest point.</p>
    <p>If the domain of the continuous function is not a closed interval, then the function may neither have maximum nor minimum. For example, for $y=x^2$ on $D=(0,2)$, there is no maximum or minimum.</p>

    <h2>Critical Points of a function</h2>
    <h3>The First Derivative Theorem for Local Extreme Values</h3>
    <p>If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum value at an interior point $c$ of its domain, and if $f'$ is defined at $c$, then $f^{\prime}(c)=0$. This means there is a horizontal tangent at $c$.</p>
    <p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong> An interior point of the domain of a function $f$ where $f'$ is zero or undefined is a critical point of $f$.</p>
    <p>Is it true that every critical point is a point of local max. or min.? (This is a question posed in the lecture, implying the answer is no).</p>

    <p>Thank you</p>
