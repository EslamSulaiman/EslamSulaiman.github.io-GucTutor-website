    <h1>CHEM 102 Lecture 6: Chemical Equilibrium</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture for CHEM 102, titled "Chemical Equilibrium", focuses on understanding the conditions under which chemical reactions reach equilibrium and the factors influencing it.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>6.1 Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define equilibrium condition.</li>
        <li>Identify factors affecting equilibrium.</li>
        <li>Apply the principles of chemical equilibrium to solve problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>6.2 Introduction to Chemical Equilibrium</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions can be broadly classified into two types: irreversible and reversible.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Irreversible Reactions:</strong> Proceed in one direction until one of the reactants is completely consumed, and the reaction stops.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversible Reactions:</strong> Can proceed in both forward and reverse directions simultaneously. They reach a state where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, leading to no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. This state is known as **chemical equilibrium**.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>6.3 The Equilibrium Constant (K)</h2>
    <p>For a general reversible reaction:</p>
    <p>\[ aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD \]</p>
    <p>where a, b, c, and d are the stoichiometric coefficients for the balanced reaction, the **equilibrium constant (K)** is a ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.</p>
    <p>The expression for K is:</p>
    <p>\[ K = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b} \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**K_c:** Used when concentrations are expressed in molarity (mol/L).</li>
        <li>**K_p:** Used for reactions involving gases, where concentrations are expressed in partial pressures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The value of K indicates the extent to which a reaction proceeds to completion at equilibrium.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If K &gt;&gt; 1, products are favored at equilibrium.</li>
        <li>If K &lt;&lt; 1, reactants are favored at equilibrium.</li>
        <li>If K â‰ˆ 1, significant amounts of both reactants and products are present at equilibrium.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6.4 Factors Affecting Chemical Equilibrium: Le Chatelier's Principle</h2>
    <p>Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress. Common factors that affect equilibrium include:</p>

    <h3>1. Change in Concentration:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding reactants:</strong> Shifts equilibrium to the right (towards products).</li>
        <li><strong>Removing reactants:</strong> Shifts equilibrium to the left (towards reactants).</li>
        <li><strong>Adding products:</strong> Shifts equilibrium to the left (towards reactants).</li>
        <li><strong>Removing products:</strong> Shifts equilibrium to the right (towards products).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Change in Temperature:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Endothermic Reactions ($\Delta H > 0$):</strong> Increasing temperature shifts equilibrium to the right (favors products). Decreasing temperature shifts equilibrium to the left.</li>
        <li><strong>For Exothermic Reactions ($\Delta H < 0$):</strong> Increasing temperature shifts equilibrium to the left (favors reactants). Decreasing temperature shifts equilibrium to the right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Change in Pressure (for gaseous reactions):</h3>
    <p>Changes in pressure only affect equilibrium if there is a change in the total number of moles of gas.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increasing pressure:</strong> Shifts equilibrium towards the side with fewer moles of gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Decreasing pressure:</strong> Shifts equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Effect of Catalyst:</h3>
    <p>A catalyst speeds up both the forward and reverse reaction rates equally. Therefore, a catalyst does **not** affect the position of equilibrium or the value of K. It only helps the system reach equilibrium faster.</p>

    <p>Understanding chemical equilibrium and Le Chatelier's Principle is crucial for optimizing chemical processes in industrial applications.</p>
