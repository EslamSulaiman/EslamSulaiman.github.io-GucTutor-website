    <h1>Physics 101 Lecture 12 (Chapter 10): Rotation of a Rigid Object about a Fixed Axis - Part I</h1>
    <h2>Rotational Kinetics - Moment of Inertia</h2>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture, presented by Dr. Nermeen Serag, introduces the fundamental concepts of rotational motion for rigid bodies, focusing on rotational kinematics, moment of inertia, torque, and rotational kinetic energy. [cite_start]It establishes parallels between linear and rotational quantities and provides essential formulas and examples for analyzing rotating systems. [cite: 102, 103, 104, 105]
    </p>

    <h2>Rigid Object Definition</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]A **rigid object (body)** is a non-deformable object whose dimensions do not change during its motion, and the relative locations of all its constituent particles remain constant. [cite: 111, 112] [cite_start]This model simplifies the analysis of extended solid objects, especially when deformation is negligible. [cite: 113]
    </p>

    <h2>Rotational Kinematics: Angular Quantities</h2>

    <h3>A. Angular Position ($\theta$)</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The angular position of a rigid object is defined as the angle between a reference line attached to the object and a fixed reference line (often the x-axis). [cite: 118, 129] It plays the same role in rotational motion as translational position ($x$) in linear motion. [cite_start]A particle at point P, located at a distance $r$ from the rotation axis, moves through an arc length $s$ on a circular path of radius $r$ as the disc rotates. [cite: 119, 120]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The arc length $s$ and radius $r$ are related by: [cite: 132, 140]
        \[ s = r\theta \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = \frac{s}{r} \]
        [cite_start]Here, $\theta$ is measured in **radians**. [cite: 132]
        [cite_start]Conversions: [cite: 145, 146]
        \[ 1 \, \text{rad} = \frac{360^\circ}{2\pi} \approx 57.3^\circ \]
        \[ \theta(\text{rad}) = \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} \theta(\text{degrees}) \]

    <h3>B. Angular Displacement ($\Delta\theta$)</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The angular displacement is the angle an object rotates through during a time interval. [cite: 153, 154]
        \[ \Delta\theta = \theta_f - \theta_i \]
        [cite_start]This is the angle that the reference line of length $r$ sweeps out. [cite: 155, 156, 157]

    <h3>C. Average Angular Speed ($\omega_{avg}$) and Instantaneous Angular Speed ($\omega$)</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The **average angular speed** ($\omega_{avg}$) of a rotating rigid object is the ratio of angular displacement to the time interval. [cite: 166, 167]
        \[ \omega_{avg}=\frac{\theta_{f}-\theta_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} \]
        [cite_start]The **instantaneous angular speed** ($\omega$) is the limit of the average speed as the time interval approaches zero. [cite: 169, 170]
        \[ \omega\equiv \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{d\theta}{dt} \]
        [cite_start]Units of angular speed are radians/second (rad/s or s⁻¹ since radians have no dimensions). [cite: 172, 173] [cite_start]Angular speed is positive for counterclockwise rotation ($\theta$ increasing) and negative for clockwise rotation ($\theta$ decreasing). [cite: 174, 175]

    <h3>D. Average Angular Acceleration ($\alpha_{avg}$) and Instantaneous Angular Acceleration ($\alpha$)</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The **average angular acceleration** ($\alpha_{avg}$) of an object is defined as the ratio of the change in angular speed to the time it takes for the object to undergo the change. [cite: 180, 181, 182]
        \[ \alpha_{avg}=\frac{\omega_{f}-\omega_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}=\frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t} \]
        [cite_start]The **instantaneous angular acceleration** ($\alpha$) is the limit of the average angular acceleration as the time goes to zero. [cite: 183, 184]
        \[ \alpha\equiv \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t}=\frac{d\omega}{dt} \]
        [cite_start]Units of angular acceleration are radians/second squared (rad/s² or s⁻²). [cite: 185] [cite_start]Angular acceleration is positive if an object rotating counterclockwise is speeding up, or if an object rotating clockwise is slowing down. [cite: 186, 187]

    <h3>E. Rotational Kinematics (Constant Angular Acceleration)</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]Under constant angular acceleration, the motion of a rigid object can be described using kinematic equations similar to those for linear motion. [cite: 203, 204]
    </p>
    | Rigid Body Under Constant Angular Acceleration | Particle Under Constant Acceleration |
    | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
    | $\omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t$               | $v_f = v_i + at$                   |
    | $\theta_f = \theta_i + \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$ | $x_f = x_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ |
    | $\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha(\theta_f - \theta_i)$ | $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a(x_f - x_i)$   |
    | $\theta_f = \theta_i + \frac{1}{2}(\omega_i + \omega_f)t$ | [cite_start]$x_f = x_i + \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$ | [cite: 209]

    <h2>Relationship Between Angular and Linear Quantities</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]Every point on a rotating object has the same angular motion ($\theta, \omega, \alpha$), but not necessarily the same linear motion because linear quantities depend on the distance $r$ from the axis of rotation. [cite: 210, 211, 212]
    </p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>**Displacement (Arc Length):** $s = r\theta$ [cite: 212]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>**Tangential Speed:** The linear velocity is always tangent to the circular path. [cite: 213]
            \[ v = r\omega \]
            [cite_start]The tangential speed increases as one moves outward from the center of rotation. [cite: 216]
        </li>
        <li>**Tangential Acceleration:**
            \[ a_t = r\alpha \]
        </li>
        [cite_start]<li>**Centripetal Acceleration:** Every point on a rotating rigid object experiences a centripetal acceleration directed towards the center. [cite: 218]
            \[ a_r = \frac{v^2}{r} = r\omega^2 \]
        </li>
        [cite_start]<li>**Total Linear Acceleration:** The tangential component is due to changing speed, and the centripetal component is due to changing direction. [cite: 219, 220]
            \[ a = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_r^2} = \sqrt{(r\alpha)^2 + (r\omega^2)^2} \]
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example: Compact Disc Player</h3>
    <p>
        For a compact disc player to read a CD, the angular speed ($\omega$) must vary to keep the tangential speed ($v_t = \omega r$) constant (typically 1.3 m/s). [cite_start]This means that at inner sections (smaller $r$), the angular speed is faster than at outer sections (larger $r$). [cite: 221, 222, 223]
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>F. Rotational Kinetic Energy ($K_R$)</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]An object rotating about some axis with an angular speed ($\omega$) has rotational kinetic energy even if it has no translational kinetic energy. [cite: 224] [cite_start]The total rotational kinetic energy of a rigid object is the sum of the energies of all its particles. [cite: 226]
        \[ K_R = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 \]
        [cite_start]Here, $I$ is the moment of inertia. [cite: 227]

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Moment of Inertia ($I$)</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The **moment of inertia ($I$)** is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion, analogous to mass in translational motion. [cite: 231] [cite_start]It depends on the mass of the object and how that mass is distributed around the rotational axis. [cite: 232]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The definition of moment of inertia for a system of discrete particles is: [cite: 228, 233]
        \[ I \equiv \sum_i m_i r_i^2 \]
        [cite_start]Where $m_i$ is the mass of the $i^{th}$ particle and $r_i$ is its perpendicular distance from the rotation axis. [cite: 228]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]For a continuous rigid object, it's calculated by integration: [cite: 233]
        \[ I = \int r^2 dm \]
        [cite_start]The dimensions of moment of inertia are ML² and its SI units are kg·m². [cite: 228]
    </p>
    <h3>Densities:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>**Volumetric Mass Density ($\rho$):** mass per unit volume ($ \rho = m / V $) [cite: 236]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>**Surface Mass Density ($\sigma$):** mass per unit thickness of a sheet of uniform thickness ($ \sigma = \rho t $) [cite: 236]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>**Linear Mass Density ($\lambda$):** mass per unit length of a rod of uniform cross-sectional area ($ \lambda = m / L = \rho A $) [cite: 236]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parallel-Axis Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The parallel-axis theorem simplifies moment of inertia calculations for an axis parallel to one passing through the center of mass. [cite: 257, 258]
        \[ I = I_{CM} + MD^2 \]
        Where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>$I$ is the moment of inertia about the arbitrary axis. [cite: 258]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>$I_{CM}$ is the moment of inertia about the axis through the center of mass. [cite: 259]</li>
        <li>$M$ is the total mass of the object.</li>
        [cite_start]<li>$D$ is the perpendicular distance from the center of mass axis to the arbitrary parallel axis. [cite: 260]</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Example: Moment of Inertia of a Rod Rotating Around One End</h4>
    <p>
        [cite_start]If the moment of inertia of a rod about its center ($I_{CM}$) is known, the moment of inertia about one end can be found using the parallel-axis theorem, where $D = L/2$. [cite: 261]

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Torque ($\tau$)</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]**Torque** ($\tau$) is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about some axis. [cite: 262]
    </p>
    <h3>Definition of Torque:</h3>
    \[ \tau = rF \sin\phi = Fd \]
    <p>
        Where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>$F$ is the force. [cite: 262]</li>
        <li>$r$ is the distance from the rotation axis to the point where the force is applied.</li>
        [cite_start]<li>$\phi$ is the angle the force makes with the position vector (or horizontal). [cite: 262]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>$d = r \sin\phi$ is the **moment arm** (or lever arm) of the force, which is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force. [cite: 262, 264]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        [cite_start]Torque has direction: counterclockwise turning tendency is positive torque, and clockwise is negative torque. [cite: 266, 267]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The SI units of torque are N·m (Newton-meters). [cite: 272] [cite_start]Although N·m is also the unit for work, torque is distinct from work and energy, and its units are not changed to Joules. [cite: 273, 274]
    </p>

    <h3>Newton's Second Law for Rotation:</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]For a particle of mass $m$ rotating in a circle of radius $r$ under a tangential force $F_t$, the tangential force provides a tangential acceleration ($F_t = ma_t$). [cite: 275, 276]
        [cite_start]The torque produced by this force is $\tau = F_t r = (ma_t)r$. [cite: 278]
        [cite_start]Since $a_t = r\alpha$, we can write: [cite: 278]
        \[ \tau = (m(r\alpha))r = (mr^2)\alpha \]
        [cite_start]Since $mr^2$ is the moment of inertia ($I$) for a particle: [cite: 279]
        \[ \tau = I\alpha \]
        [cite_start]This is Newton's Second Law for rotation, showing that torque is directly proportional to angular acceleration, with the moment of inertia as the constant of proportionality. [cite: 279]

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Work and Power in Rotational Motion</h2>
    <h3>Work Done by a Torque:</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The work done by a tangential force (the radial component does no work as it's perpendicular to displacement) on an object rotating through an infinitesimal angular displacement $d\theta$ is $dW = \tau d\theta$. [cite: 280, 281]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The work-kinetic energy theorem for rotational motion states that the net work done by external forces in rotating a symmetrical rigid object about a fixed axis equals the change in the object’s rotational kinetic energy: [cite: 282]
        \[ \sum W = \frac{1}{2}I\omega_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}I\omega_i^2 \]
        [cite_start]This can be combined with the linear form, indicating that the net work done by external forces on an object is the change in its total kinetic energy (translational + rotational). [cite: 283]

    <h3>Power Delivered by a Torque:</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The rate at which work is done by an external force in rotating a rigid object about a fixed axis (power delivered) is: [cite: 282]
        \[ P = \tau\omega \]
        [cite_start]This is analogous to $P = Fv$ in a linear system. [cite: 282]

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Rolling Object</h2>
    <p>
        [cite_start]In **pure rolling motion**, an object rolls without slipping. [cite: 86]
    </p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>The path traced by a point on the rim of the object is a cycloid. [cite: 85]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The path of the center of mass of the object is a straight line. [cite: 85]</li>
        [cite_start]<li>The contact point between the surface and the rolling object has a translational speed of zero at any instant. [cite: 89]</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Translational and Angular Relationships for Pure Rolling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Translational speed of the center of mass:**
            \[ v_{CM} = R\omega \]
        </li>
        <li>**Linear acceleration of the center of mass:**
            \[ a_{CM} = R\alpha \]
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Total Kinetic Energy of a Rolling Object:</h3>
    <p>
        [cite_start]The total kinetic energy ($K$) of a rolling object is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of its center of mass and the rotational kinetic energy about its center of mass. [cite: 90]
        \[ K = \frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}Mv_{CM}^2 \]
        [cite_start]Where $\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\omega^2$ is the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass, and $\frac{1}{2}Mv_{CM}^2$ is the translational kinetic energy of the center of mass. [cite: 91, 92]
    </p>
    <h3>Example: Rolling Down an Incline</h3>
    <p>
        Accelerated rolling motion down an incline is possible only if friction is present, which provides the net torque for rotation. [cite_start]However, for ideal rolling without slipping, no mechanical energy is lost due to friction because the contact point is instantaneously at rest relative to the surface. [cite: 93, 95]
        [cite_start]Applying Conservation of Mechanical Energy (where $U=0$ at the bottom of the plane): [cite: 98]
        \[ K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i \]
        \[ \left(\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\omega_f^2 + \frac{1}{2}Mv_{CM,f}^2\right) + 0 = 0 + Mgh \]
        Using $v_{CM,f} = R\omega_f$ and substituting $\omega_f = v_{CM,f}/R$:
        \[ \frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\left(\frac{v_{CM,f}}{R}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}Mv_{CM,f}^2 = Mgh \]
        \[ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{I_{CM}}{R^2} + M\right)v_{CM,f}^2 = Mgh \]
        [cite_start]Solving for $v_{CM,f}$: [cite: 98]
        \[ v_{CM,f} = \sqrt{\frac{2Mgh}{\frac{I_{CM}}{R^2} + M}} \]
    </p>
    <h3>Quiz Example: Ball vs. Box on Incline</h3>
    <p>
        A ball rolls without slipping down incline A, starting from rest. Simultaneously, a box starts from rest and slides down incline B, which is identical to A but frictionless. [cite_start]Which arrives at the bottom first? [cite: 99, 100]
    </p>
    <p>
        [cite_start]**Answer:** The box arrives first. [cite: 100]
        **Reasoning:** The box only has translational kinetic energy at the bottom. The ball, in addition to translational kinetic energy, also has rotational kinetic energy. For the same initial potential energy, the ball converts some of its potential energy into rotational kinetic energy, leaving less for translational kinetic energy compared to the box. Therefore, the box will have a higher final translational speed and reach the bottom first.
