    <h1>CHEM 102 Lecture 4: Chemical Reactions</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture for CHEM 102 introduces the concept of chemical reactions, their representation through chemical equations, and common types of reactions.
    </p>

    <h2>4.1 What is a Chemical Reaction?</h2>
    <p>A chemical reaction is a process that involves the rearrangement of the atomic structure of substances, resulting in the formation of new substances with different properties. This involves the breaking of existing chemical bonds and the formation of new ones. Chemical reactions are accompanied by changes in energy (e.g., release or absorption of heat or light).</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>4.2 Chemical Equations</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented by **chemical equations**. A chemical equation uses chemical formulas to show the reactants (starting materials) and products (substances formed) of a reaction, as well as their stoichiometric relationships.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reactants:</strong> Written on the left side of the arrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Products:</strong> Written on the right side of the arrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrow (\(\rightarrow\)):</strong> Indicates the direction of the reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Coefficients:</strong> Numbers placed in front of chemical formulas to balance the equation, ensuring the law of conservation of mass is upheld (same number of atoms of each element on both sides).</li>
        <li><strong>State Symbols:</strong> Indicate the physical state of reactants and products (e.g., (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, (g) for gas, (aq) for aqueous solution).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: The combustion of methane (balanced equation):</p>
    <p>\[ CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g) \]</p>

    <h2>4.3 Common Types of Chemical Reactions</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions can be classified into several categories based on their patterns of reactivity:</p>

    <h3>4.3.1 Combination (Synthesis) Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Two or more reactants combine to form a single, more complex product.</li>
        <li><strong>General Form:</strong> \(A + B \rightarrow AB\)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> \(2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O(l)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3.2 Decomposition Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. These often require energy input (heat, light, electricity).</li>
        <li><strong>General Form:</strong> \(AB \rightarrow A + B\)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> \(2H_2O(l) \xrightarrow{electrolysis} 2H_2(g) + O_2(g)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3.3 Single Displacement (Replacement) Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> One element replaces another element in a compound.</li>
        <li><strong>General Form:</strong> \(A + BC \rightarrow AC + B\) (where A is a metal) or \(A + BC \rightarrow BA + C\) (where A is a non-metal)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> \(Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow ZnCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3.4 Double Displacement (Metathesis) Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) of two different compounds exchange places, forming two new compounds. These often result in the formation of a precipitate, gas, or water.</li>
        <li><strong>General Form:</strong> \(AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB\)</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> \(AgNO_3(aq) + NaCl(aq) \rightarrow AgCl(s) + NaNO_3(aq)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3.5 Combustion Reactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A substance rapidly reacts with oxygen, typically producing heat and light (a flame). For hydrocarbons, the products are usually carbon dioxide and water.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> \(CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding chemical reactions is essential for predicting products, designing synthetic pathways, and analyzing natural phenomena in various engineering fields.</p>
