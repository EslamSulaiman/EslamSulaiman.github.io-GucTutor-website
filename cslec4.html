    <h1>CSEN102 Introduction to Computer Science: Lecture 4</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture for CSEN102: Introduction to Computer Science, given by Milad Ghantous, PhD, covers fundamental programming constructs including conditional statements and loops.
    </p>

    <h2>4.1 Control Structures: Overview</h2>
    <p>Control structures are fundamental to programming as they dictate the flow of execution in a program. They allow programs to make decisions, repeat actions, and respond to various conditions.</p>

    <h3>Types of Control Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Instructions are executed one after another in the order they appear. This is the default flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Selection (Conditional Statements):</strong> Allows the program to choose between different paths of execution based on a condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition (Loops):</strong> Allows a block of code to be executed multiple times.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>4.2 Selection Statements (Conditionals)</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements allow a program to perform different actions based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. They are essential for decision-making within programs.</p>

    <h3>1. If Statement:</h3>
    <p>Executes a block of code only if a condition is true.</p>
    <pre><code>if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>2. If-Else Statement:</h3>
    <p>Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.</p>
    <pre><code>if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>3. If-Else If-Else Statement (Nested Conditionals):</h3>
    <p>Allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.</p>
    <pre><code>if (condition1) {
    // code for condition1
} else if (condition2) {
    // code for condition2
} else {
    // code if none of the above conditions are met
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>4. Switch Statement (or equivalent):</h3>
    <p>Provides a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed. Often used when comparing a single variable against multiple discrete values.</p>
    <pre><code>switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // code if variable matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code if variable matches value2
        break;
    default:
        // code if variable does not match any case
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>Logical Operators:</h3>
    <p>Used to combine or modify conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>AND</code> (&&): Both conditions must be true.</li>
        <li><code>OR</code> (||): At least one condition must be true.</li>
        <li><code>NOT</code> (!): Reverses the logical state of the condition.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>4.3 Repetition Statements (Loops)</h2>
    <p>Loops allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a certain condition is met or a specified number of times.</p>

    <h3>1. While Loop:</h3>
    <p>Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.</p>
    <pre><code>while (condition) {
    // code to repeat
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Do-While Loop:</h3>
    <p>Similar to a while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked. The condition is checked after each iteration.</p>
    <pre><code>do {
    // code to repeat
} while (condition);
</code></pre>

    <h3>3. For Loop:</h3>
    <p>Repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.</p>
    <pre><code>for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to repeat
}
</code></pre>

    <h3>Loop Control Statements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>break;</code>: Terminates the loop immediately.</li>
        <li><code>continue;</code>: Skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.</li>
    </ul>
