    <h2>Chapter 3: Manufacturing Processes</h2>

    <h3>Material Removal Processes</h3>
    <p>Material removal processes are manufacturing operations that remove unwanted material from a starting workpiece to create a desired shape. These processes are crucial for achieving specific dimensions, surface finishes, and geometries.</p>

    <h4>Categories of Material Removal Processes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Machining (Cutting Processes):</strong> Involves the use of a sharp cutting tool to mechanically shear away material in the form of chips. This is the most common category.</li>
        <li><strong>Abrasive Processes:</strong> Remove material by the action of hard, abrasive particles. Examples include grinding and honing.</li>
        <li><strong>Nontraditional Processes (Advanced Machining):</strong> Use various energy forms (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical) to remove material, often without a sharp cutting tool. Used for materials that are difficult to machine by conventional methods.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h3>Machining Operations</h3>
    <p>Machining involves relative motion between the workpiece and the cutting tool, and a cutting edge that separates the chip from the workpiece. Key parameters in machining include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cutting Speed (v):</strong> Primary motion that provides the energy to cut the material. Measured in meters per minute (m/min) or feet per minute (ft/min).</li>
        <li><strong>Feed (f):</strong> Secondary motion that advances the tool into the workpiece. Measured in mm/revolution or mm/tooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Depth of Cut (d):</strong> The thickness of the material removed in one pass of the tool. Measured in mm or inches.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common Machining Operations:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Turning:</strong> Performed on a lathe. The workpiece rotates, and a single-point cutting tool moves linearly to remove material from the external or internal diameter.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Facing, tapering, contour turning, form turning, chamfering, threading, boring, drilling, knurling.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drilling:</strong> Creates a round hole. The tool (drill bit) rotates and is fed into the stationary workpiece.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Through holes, blind holes, reaming (improving hole accuracy), tapping (creating internal threads), counterboring (creating a stepped hole), countersinking (creating a conical hole), spot facing (creating a flat surface around a hole).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Milling:</strong> Uses a rotating multi-edge cutter to remove material from a workpiece.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Peripheral Milling (Slab Milling):</strong> The axis of the cutter is parallel to the surface being machined.</li>
                        <li><strong>Face Milling:</strong> The axis of the cutter is perpendicular to the surface being machined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cutting Tool Materials</h3>
    <p>Cutting tools must possess specific properties to withstand the harsh conditions during machining:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Significantly harder than the workpiece material at elevated temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Toughness and Impact Strength:</strong> Ability to absorb energy without fracturing, especially during interrupted cuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Wear Resistance:</strong> Resistance to abrasion, adhesion, and diffusion wear, ensuring tool longevity.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Hardness:</strong> Ability to retain hardness at the high temperatures generated during cutting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common Tool Materials:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>High-Speed Steel (HSS):</strong> A common and versatile tool material. Good toughness, but limited hot hardness.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbides (Cemented Carbides):</strong> Much harder and better hot hardness than HSS. Very common for higher cutting speeds. Often used as inserts.</li>
        <li><strong>Ceramics:</strong> Excellent hardness and hot hardness, but brittle. Used for high-speed machining of cast iron and hardened steel.</li>
        <li><strong>Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN):</strong> Extremely hard, second only to diamond. Used for machining hardened steels and superalloys.</li>
        <li><strong>Diamond:</strong> The hardest known material. Used for machining non-ferrous materials, ceramics, and for fine finishing. Not suitable for ferrous metals due to chemical reaction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tool Geometry (Single-Point Cutting Tools)</h3>
    <p>The geometry of a cutting tool affects chip formation, heat generation, and tool life. Key angles include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rake Angle:</strong> Controls the direction of chip flow and affects cutting forces.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive Rake Angle:</strong> Reduces cutting forces, but can weaken the tool edge.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Rake Angle:</strong> Increases strength of the cutting edge, suitable for hard materials or interrupted cuts, but increases cutting forces.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Rake Angle:</strong> Intermediate behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Relief/Clearance Angle:</strong> Prevents the tool flank from rubbing against the machined surface, reducing friction and heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Nose Radius:</strong> Affects surface finish and tool strength. A larger nose radius generally improves surface finish but can lead to chatter.</li>
    </ul>
