    <h2>1.1 Introduction to Physics 101</h2>
    <p>This course is Physics 101, designed for Engineering Students. The lecture is presented by Dr. Ahmed Maarouf.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Units and Physical Quantities</h2>
    <p>Physics deals with measurable phenomena, which are described using physical quantities. Each physical quantity has a specific unit for its measurement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Quantities:</strong> Properties of phenomena, bodies, or substances that can be measured. Examples include length, mass, time, temperature, and electric current.</li>
        <li><strong>Units:</strong> Standard measures for physical quantities. The International System of Units (SI) is commonly used in science and engineering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2.1 SI Base Units (Fundamental Units)</h3>
    <p>These are the core units from which all other units are derived:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length:</strong> Meter (m)</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Kilogram (kg)</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> Second (s)</li>
        <li><strong>Electric Current:</strong> Ampere (A)</li>
        <li><strong>Thermodynamic Temperature:</strong> Kelvin (K)</li>
        <li><strong>Amount of Substance:</strong> Mole (mol)</li>
        <li><strong>Luminous Intensity:</strong> Candela (cd)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2.2 Derived Units</h3>
    <p>These units are formed by combining base units. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Area:</strong> square meters (m²)</li>
        <li><strong>Volume:</strong> cubic meters (m³)</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> meters per second (m/s)</li>
        <li><strong>Density:</strong> kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³)</li>
        <li><strong>Force:</strong> Newton (N), which is kg·m/s²</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3 Vector and Scalar Quantities</h2>
    <p>Physical quantities can be classified based on whether they have direction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalar Quantities:</strong> Quantities that have only magnitude (a numerical value and a unit). They do not have a direction.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Mass, time, temperature, speed, distance, energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vector Quantities:</strong> Quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are represented graphically by arrows, where the length of the arrow indicates magnitude and the arrowhead indicates direction.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.4 Vector Operations (Introduction)</h2>
    <p>Vectors require specific rules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, unlike scalar quantities. Basic vector operations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vector Addition:</strong> Can be done graphically (head-to-tail method, parallelogram method) or analytically (component method).</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Subtraction:</strong> Defined as adding the negative of a vector (e.g., A - B = A + (-B)).</li>
        <li><strong>Scalar Multiplication:</strong> Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude but not its direction (if the scalar is positive).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding these fundamental concepts of units, physical quantities, and vectors is essential for further study in mechanics and other areas of physics relevant to engineering.</p>
