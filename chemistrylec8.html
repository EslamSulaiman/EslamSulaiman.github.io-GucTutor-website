    <h1>CHEM 102 Lecture 7: Materials Chemistry</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture for CHEM 102, titled "Materials Chemistry," focuses on understanding different types of engineering materials, their classification, and how chemistry plays a role in their manufacturing from ores.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>By the end of this lecture, the student should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify different types of engineering materials.</li>
        <li>Use the periodic table to identify the possible type of materials.</li>
        <li>Understand how chemistry is used to manufacture materials from their ores.</li>
        <li>Understand the difference between compounds, composites, and alloys.</li>
        <li>Categorize any materials based on their physical properties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elements and Materials</h2>
    <p>Materials are substances with applications that have sequentially aided human development. Materials can be found in Earth's crust (e.g., Silicon (Si), Iron (Fe)) and atmosphere (e.g., Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O)).</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Materials Classification</h2>
    <h3>Classical Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Metals:** Possess properties like being lustrous (shiny), good conductors of heat and electricity, high melting points, high density, malleability (can be hammered into sheets), ductility (can be drawn into wires), and are usually solid at room temperature.
            <br><em>Examples:</em> Electrical wiring, structural components in buildings and automobiles.
        </li>
        <li>**Ceramics:** Generally inorganic, non-metallic solids with high strength, hardness, and high melting points; often insulators.</li>
        <li>**Polymers:** Large chain-like molecules, including plastics and rubbers, known for flexibility and low density.</li>
        <li>**Semiconductors:** Materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators (e.g., Silicon, Germanium).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advanced Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Composites:** Materials made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties which remain separate and distinct at the macroscopic or microscopic level within the finished structure.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Fiberglass (glass fibers in a polymer matrix), carbon fiber.
        </li>
        <li>**Electronic Materials:** Materials used in electronic components and circuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Occurrence of Metals</h2>
    <p>Metals exist in various forms in Earth's surface (e.g., Aluminum (Al), Iron (Fe), Silicon (Si)), sea water (e.g., Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg)), and the ocean floor (e.g., Copper (Cu), Cobalt (Co), Manganese (Mn)). Most metals come from minerals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Mineral:** A naturally occurring substance with a range of chemical compositions.</li>
        <li>**Ore:** A mineral or rock from which a metal can be extracted economically.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Hematite ($\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) and Magnetite ($\text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4$) are common iron ores. Bauxite ($\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot \text{n}\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is the primary ore for Aluminum.
        </li>
    </ul>
