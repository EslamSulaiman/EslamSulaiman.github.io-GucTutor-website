    <h1>CHEM 102 Lecture 5: Stoichiometry</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture for CHEM 102 focuses on Stoichiometry, a fundamental concept in chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>5.1 Introduction to Stoichiometry</h2>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the area of chemistry that involves calculating the amounts of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means the total mass of reactants must equal the total mass of products.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>5.2 The Mole Concept and Avogadro's Number</h2>
    <p>A crucial concept in stoichiometry is the **mole (mol)**. The mole is the SI unit for the amount of substance. One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.).</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li>**Avogadro's Number:** Approximately \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles/mol[cite: 1].</li>
        <li>The mole provides a way to relate the macroscopic world (mass you can weigh) to the microscopic world (individual atoms and molecules).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>5.3 Molar Mass</h2>
    <p>The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance, typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). For elements, the molar mass is numerically equal to its atomic mass in atomic mass units (amu). For compounds, it is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in the chemical formula.</p>
    <p>For example, the molar mass of \(H_2O\) is approximately (2 * 1.008 g/mol for H) + (1 * 15.999 g/mol for O) = 18.015 g/mol.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>5.4 Balancing Chemical Equations</h2>
    <p>Before performing stoichiometric calculations, chemical equations must be balanced. Balancing ensures that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation, thus obeying the law of conservation of mass.</p>
    <p>Example: The unbalanced reaction for the combustion of methane:</p>
    <p>\[ CH_4 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \]</p>
    <p>The balanced equation is:</p>
    <p>\[ CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O \]</p>

    <h2>5.5 Stoichiometric Calculations</h2>
    <p>Stoichiometry allows us to perform various calculations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Mole-to-Mole Conversions:** Using the mole ratios from the balanced chemical equation to convert moles of one substance to moles of another.</li>
        <li>**Mass-to-Mole Conversions:** Using molar mass to convert between grams and moles of a substance.</li>
        <li>**Mole-to-Mass Conversions:** Using molar mass to convert moles of a substance to grams.</li>
        <li>**Mass-to-Mass Conversions:** Combining the above steps to convert the mass of a reactant to the mass of a product, or vice versa. This typically involves: Mass A -> Moles A -> Moles B -> Mass B.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stoichiometry is crucial for chemical engineers and chemists to predict product yields, determine reactant requirements, and optimize chemical processes efficiently.</p>
