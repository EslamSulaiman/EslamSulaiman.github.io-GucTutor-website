    <h2>1.2 What is Computer Science?</h2>
    <p>Computer Science is the study of computation and information. It is a broad field that deals with algorithms, computation, information processing, and the design of computing systems.</p>

    <h3>Key Areas in Computer Science</h3>
    <p>Computer Science encompasses various sub-disciplines, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> Efficient methods for organizing and processing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Design, implementation, and theory of languages used to instruct computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Architecture:</strong> Design of computer hardware and its components.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Software that manages computer hardware and software resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Principles for designing, developing, and maintaining software systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Developing intelligent machines that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Networks:</strong> Connecting computers for communication and resource sharing.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Protecting computer systems and networks from threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3 What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data, and perform calculations and logical operations at high speed.</p>

    <h3>Components of a Computer System</h3>
    <p>A typical computer system consists of two main categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> The physical components of a computer.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Temporary storage for data and programs currently in use.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Permanent storage for data (e.g., Hard Disk Drives, Solid State Drives).</li>
                <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices used to provide data to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, microphone).</li>
                <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices used to display or present results from the computer (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> The set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Manages and controls the computer hardware (e.g., Operating Systems like Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed to perform specific tasks for users (e.g., word processors, web browsers, games).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>1.4 How Computers Work: The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle</h2>
    <p>Computers operate by continuously performing a cycle of operations to process instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The CPU retrieves an instruction from memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Decode:</strong> The CPU interprets the fetched instruction to determine what operation needs to be performed.</li>
        <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The CPU performs the operation specified by the instruction. This might involve arithmetic calculations, data movement, or logical operations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This cycle repeats millions or billions of times per second, enabling the computer to perform complex tasks rapidly.</p>

    <p>Thank you</p>
