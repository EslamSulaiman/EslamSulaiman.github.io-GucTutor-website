    <h1>CHEM 102 Lecture 3: Chemical Bonding</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
        This lecture introduces the fundamental concepts of chemical bonding, explaining why atoms form bonds and the different types of bonds that result in the formation of compounds.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>3.1 Why Do Atoms Form Bonds?</h2>
    <p>Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a more stable electron configuration, typically resembling that of a noble gas (an octet of valence electrons, or a duet for hydrogen and helium). This tendency is known as the **octet rule**. The formation of bonds lowers the potential energy of the atoms involved, making the resulting compound more stable.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>3.2 Types of Chemical Bonds</h2>
    <p>The main types of chemical bonds are ionic bonds and covalent bonds.</p>

    <h3>3.2.1 Ionic Bonds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Occur between a metal and a non-metal. They involve the **transfer** of electrons from one atom to another.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The metal atom loses one or more valence electrons to become a positively charged ion (cation), and the non-metal atom gains these electrons to become a negatively charged ion (anion).</li>
        <li><strong>Attraction:</strong> The resulting oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other by electrostatic forces, forming a strong ionic bond.</li>
        <li><strong>Properties of Ionic Compounds:</strong> Typically form crystalline solids, have high melting and boiling points, and conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Sodium Chloride (NaCl), where Na transfers an electron to Cl.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2.2 Covalent Bonds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Occur between two non-metal atoms. They involve the **sharing** of electrons between atoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration (usually an octet). The shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, holding them together.</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Covalent Bonds:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Bond:</strong> Two atoms share one pair of electrons.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Bond:</strong> Two atoms share two pairs of electrons.</li>
                <li><strong>Triple Bond:</strong> Two atoms share three pairs of electrons.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Polarity:</strong> Covalent bonds can be polar (unequal sharing of electrons due to difference in electronegativity) or nonpolar (equal sharing).</li>
        <li><strong>Properties of Covalent Compounds (Molecules):</strong> Can exist as solids, liquids, or gases, generally have lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds, and are typically poor conductors of electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Water (Hâ‚‚O), where oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.3 Metallic Bonds (Brief Mention)</h2>
    <p>Metallic bonds are found in metals and alloys. They involve a "sea" of delocalized valence electrons shared among a lattice of positively charged metal ions. This model explains properties like electrical conductivity, malleability, and ductility of metals.</p>

    <p>Understanding chemical bonding is fundamental to predicting the properties of substances and designing new materials in engineering.</p>
