    <h2>Chapter 2: Engineering Materials</h2>

    <h3>Mechanical Properties of Metals</h3>
    <p>Mechanical properties determine a material's behavior under applied forces. These properties are crucial for selecting the right material for a specific engineering application.</p>

    <h4>1. Strength</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A material's ability to withstand an applied stress without failure. Stress is defined as force per unit area.</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Strength:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yield Strength (Yield Point):</strong> The stress at which a material begins to deform plastically (permanently). Beyond this point, the material will not return to its original shape after the load is removed.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS):</strong> The maximum stress a material can withstand before necking (localized reduction in cross-sectional area) begins, leading to fracture.</li>
                <li><strong>Fracture Strength:</strong> The stress at which the material actually breaks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Hardness</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A material's resistance to permanent indentation, scratching, or abrasion. It is often related to tensile strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Hardness is an important property in applications where materials are subjected to wear or localized deformation, such as gears, bearings, and cutting tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement Methods:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brinell Hardness Test (HB):</strong> Uses a hardened steel or tungsten carbide ball indentor. Suitable for softer to medium-hard materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Rockwell Hardness Test (HR):</strong> Uses a cone or ball indentor. Different scales (e.g., HRC, HRB) for various material types and hardness ranges. Quick and widely used.</li>
                <li><strong>Vickers Hardness Test (HV):</strong> Uses a diamond pyramid indentor. Suitable for very hard materials and thin sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Knoop Hardness Test (HK):</strong> Uses a diamond pyramidal indentor, often used for very small or brittle materials.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Ductility</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a material to deform plastically under tensile stress without fracturing. It is the ability to be drawn into a wire.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Often quantified by percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area in a tensile test.</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Ductile materials can be shaped by processes like drawing, forging, and extrusion. They also tend to absorb more energy before fracture, making them safer in many applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Brittleness</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The opposite of ductility. A brittle material exhibits little or no plastic deformation before fracture. It breaks suddenly under stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cast iron, ceramics, glass.</li>
    <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Brittle materials are generally not suitable for applications where shock loading or significant deformation is expected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Malleability</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a material to deform plastically under compressive stress without fracturing. It is the ability to be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Malleable materials are suitable for processes like rolling and forging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Toughness</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a material to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. It represents the resistance to crack propagation.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Represented by the area under the stress-strain curve up to fracture. Also measured by impact tests (e.g., Charpy or Izod tests).</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Tough materials are desirable in applications subjected to impact or sudden loads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity, Young's Modulus - E)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A material's resistance to elastic deformation under stress. It is the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region of the stress-strain curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong> $E = \frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$</li>
        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> A higher modulus of elasticity indicates a stiffer material, meaning it deforms less under a given load within its elastic limit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Elasticity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a material to return to its original shape and size after the applied load is removed. This deformation is temporary and non-permanent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9. Plasticity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a material to undergo permanent (plastic) deformation without fracture when subjected to stress beyond its elastic limit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>10. Creep</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Time-dependent plastic deformation of a material under a constant load at elevated temperatures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>11. Fatigue</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Failure of a material under repeated or cyclic loading, even if the applied stresses are below the material's yield strength.</li>
    </ul>
